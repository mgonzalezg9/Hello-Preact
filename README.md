# hello-preact

## Creation
This project has been created using `npx preact-cli create default hello-preact`, where the used template is the default one and the name of the project is `hello-preact`.

Once done this, [babel JSX plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#installation) was installed. This allows us to write JSX code without importing `h` from `preact`.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```
